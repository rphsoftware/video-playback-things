# Minecraft desktop streaming

## How do I run this?

Right now this entire thing uses hardcoded directory paths and is generally messy. I will clean it up in the coming days.

## I still want to run this

You want to clean up the code, replace the hardcoded paths with your own ones, compile the plugin and first
- make ramdisk
- run the rust program
- run the nodejs program
- wait ~30 seconds
- start recording with ffmpeg (according to the command in commands.txt)
- join the server


## Using the plugin

Run /videoads:image2 <number> to give yourself a number of increasing ID maps

Run /videoads:image3 <number> to explicitly set the number of maps involved

Run /videoads:image <number> to start the streaming. Number here is the starting map ID.
